# Automated-Greenhouse-System
Developed a simulated greenhouse integrating electrical, thermal, and mechanical subsystems using MATLAB and Simulink. Built an interactive GUI to control heater power, fan speed, and water flow in real time. Implemented Lagrangian Differential-Algebraic Equations solved with ODE45 to model system dynamics, visualize temperature and growth responses, and optimize control strategies in a 4-member collaborative project.
